				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a developer and designer, currently located in Ontario. I'm generally stoked to go
					jogging, climbing, take photos, or chill with my sexy wife and cute daughter.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm under contract full-time with an agency Salt Lake City called Obejctive. I work on
					projects big and small, everything from single page marketing sites built with NextJS to
					massive B2B platforms built with Elixir.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not accepting new client work, generally, but I'd love to hear about and help out (if
					I can) any intresting projects you are working on. Especially if those projects have to do
					with animal rights, the environment or are overly artistic in nature.
				</p>
				<p>Any way I can stick it to the man, man.</p>
