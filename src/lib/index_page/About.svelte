						I'm a developer and designer, currently located in Ontario. I'm generally stoked to go
						jogging, climbing, take photos, or chill with my sexy wife and cute daughter.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm under contract full-time with an agency Salt Lake City called Obejctive. I work on
						projects big and small, everything from single page marketing sites built with NextJS to
						massive B2B platforms built with Elixir.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm not accepting new client work, generally, but I'd love to hear about and help out (if
						I can) any intresting projects you are working on. Especially if those projects have to do
						with animal rights, the environment or are overly artistic in nature.
					</p>
					<p>Any way I can stick it to the man, man.</p>
