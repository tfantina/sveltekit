	<li><strong>2022</strong> I'm currently working, fulltime and 100% remote, as a contractor for Objective. In my day job I write lots of Elixir. In the evenings I'm fixing up my personal website, playing with Svelte and Greensock.  My wife, daughter, and I have been doing a bit of travelling, we are looking for warmer climates to settle in.</li>
